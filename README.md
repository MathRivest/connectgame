connectgame
===========

In order to test the game, you can use 2 browsers (Firefox and chrome for isntance), 
IE is not supported, or play with someone else. 
But you should really try at least once with 2 browsers to get a nice surprise

If a serious bug is encountered, unfortunately node stops, meaning we have to restart the server.

This is a  very very early stage of development and is maintained for training purposes, do not use in production.
